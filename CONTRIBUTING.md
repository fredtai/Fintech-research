# Contributing

Skills are markdown files. Adding a new one means writing a short, opinionated entry point that teaches a lens or methodology, then submitting a pull request.

## Where skills live

```
community-skills/
├── discover/         — Idea generation
├── analyze/          — Company analysis
├── monitor/          — Position tracking
└── economic-research/— Macro & economic research
```

Pick the folder that matches what your skill helps with. If none fit, propose a new folder in your PR description.

Skills are intent-routed through the project's `CLAUDE.md` — there's no slash command or auto-discovery. When a user's request matches a skill, Claude reads the file and follows it. New skills become discoverable by adding a one-line entry to the capability map in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Two kinds of skill files

**Skill card (`<topic>.md`)** — Short. Teaches a lens. Why it matters, what it reveals that standard analysis misses, how to invoke it. About 200-400 words. Ends with a "What you can ask" list of example user questions.

**Deep workflow (`<topic>-workflow.md`)** — Optional companion to a skill card. Contains the formalized procedure: which drillr tables to query, which SEC filings to search, the scoring rubric, the output format. Used when the user wants the full systematic version.

Most contributions are skill cards. Add a workflow only when there's a specific procedure worth formalizing.

## Skill card template

```markdown
# [Topic Name]

[One-sentence opener that frames the lens.]

[2-3 paragraphs explaining why this approach reveals something standard analysis misses, what the analyst is actually looking for, and what's non-obvious about it. No SQL. No procedure. No engineering language. Write like a sharp colleague explaining their own framework.]

**What you can ask:**
- "[Example natural-language question 1]"
- "[Example natural-language question 2]"
- "[Example natural-language question 3]"
```

---

## Deep workflow template

```markdown
# Skill: [Topic Name]

**Input:** [what the user provides — usually a ticker or theme]
**Output:** [what gets produced]

---

## Step 1 — [Stage name]

[Description of what to do, with concrete SQL templates or specific drillr tool calls.]

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ticker = '<TICKER>'
```

## Step 2 — [Stage name]

...

## Output Format

[Concrete structure of what the analysis should produce — tables, scoring rubrics, etc.]
```

## What good skills look like

- **Specific over generic.** "Track non-GAAP gap widening over 3 years" beats "look at financials carefully."
- **Why-first.** Lead with what the analyst is actually trying to learn, then the how.
- **Analyst voice.** Read like a senior investor talking to a junior, not a tutorial.
- **Honest about limits.** If the approach has known weaknesses or fails in certain conditions, say so.

---

## What to avoid

- Don't restate what the data shows. Skills teach the lens, not the answer.
- Don't write tutorials about drillr or Claude Code itself.
- Don't add procedural ceremony. If the skill can be expressed as one paragraph, write one paragraph.
- Don't include SQL in skill cards (only in `-workflow.md` files).

## Submitting

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your file in the right folder
3. Open a PR with a brief description: which folder, what lens, why it's worth adding
4. Be open to feedback — the bar for inclusion is whether a working analyst would find it genuinely useful

If your skill is highly opinionated or domain-specific (e.g., a particular sector lens), that's fine — say so in the file and the PR.

## Translated READMEs

`README.md` is the canonical source. Localized versions live alongside it: `README.ja.md` (Japanese), `README.zh-CN.md` (Simplified Chinese). If you change the English README in a way that affects substance — not just typo fixes — please update the translations in the same PR, or flag it in the PR description so a native-speaker maintainer can follow up. Translations are allowed to localize examples (tickers, market references) where natural, but section structure should stay aligned across files.
